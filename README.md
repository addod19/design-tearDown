# Design-TearDown 

> This project is a part of series of project to be completed by students of [microverse](micrioverse.org) remote school for softeware developer. This project is a collaborative project but I worked on it alone (for some reason), I designed a replica of the famous [https://www.smashingmagazine.com/](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/) website.
